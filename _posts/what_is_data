title: What is data?! Seriously, I don't know...
---

After reading the background information provided about **data**, I soon realized there is an entire language out there I was overlooking. That language is code. There are so many ways to describe different actions that its overwhelming. 

As a first time coder, I really struggled with visualizing the data. I imagine that the data structure for the **card picker** would be similiar to the Reville ID card example used in the background reading. I feel as though this is easy to understand as a visual learner and an eefective way to create a virtual ID card. The other two websites gave me more trouble. Based on my understanding, I believe the "Based on a true story" site used compound data with scalar components in order to process the data. However, I will probably do external research to be sure.
