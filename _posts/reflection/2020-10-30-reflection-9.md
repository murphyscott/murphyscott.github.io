This past week's reading was about how we can engage our different types of audiences. However, instead of trying to appeal to both a stay at home mom looking for a recipe and a teenage boy just browsing the interweb, we learned about the differences between implied and reak audience. I personally had never heard these terms before but was so excited to read about something was in the English realm of the world instead of the coding black hole I seem to have found myself in. You may be asking yourself "but Murph, your title has nothing to do with identifying audiences?" Well little imaginary fan, you'd be right. In addition to reading about the importance of connecting with an audience, I also learned something coding related known as the iframe tag. 
Now this may sound like something Apple came up with but don't be fooled. The first time I saw this tag was when I started embedding my weekly gif reactions. I thought it was gibberish and basically ignored it... However, due to my rant last week about our tracery activity, Dr.P reached out with some great advice on how to correctly display my tracery activity with an opening image or gif. Thus, this week I spent the majority of my time learning about iframe tags and how to use them. It was surprisingly simple but still reminded me of some black magic. Only becasue it will show up on my home page in the correct format but sadly when I go to click on the post it says *404 Error*. (I never thought an error message could piss me off so much). But don't you worry my imaginary fans, I will overcome this obstacle! Pictured below is me doing just that!

In addition to framing and playing tag (get it because iframe is a tag) I have also started to brainstorm what I should do for my final proposal. Sadly, the ideas are a little low in that department. Originally I thought that I could create this super sophisticated site that would maybe score me some points in a job interview. Although that just is not my style. I want to create something fun and full of life that people can say "this is the silliest most goofy thing ever but it makes me happy". I'm not sure if this will be a game or a generator or what.. I guess you'll just have to stick around to find out.
