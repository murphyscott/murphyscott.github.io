title: "Reflection 3: Achieving Goals! YAY!"
---
This week we learned about Markdown code versus HTML. Markdown and HTML have many differences including: 
1. Differences between HTML and Markdown
	* Markdown is simplier
	* HTML gives the user more control over the content and structure of the site 
	* HTML provides further information for site structures

As a new coder, I think getting my feet wet with markdown then transitioning to HTML is the best plan of action. Funny enough most of my coding goals were answered through this weeks activity.

1. My Goals
	* insert a picture, gif, and video 
	* successfullycreate a list 
	* personalize my page 
	* organize blog with headings 

The activity and reading for this week included **ALL** of these functions. SCORE! I guess I need to start searching for new goals. Understanding HTML markup will definitely be on that list. I also want to be able to code and maybe embed a simple game. This desire spurs from my days as a preteen. One time in middle school my friend, Sophia Shams, created a game based off of her cousin's new diet. She entitled the game *Paleo Faileo* because her cousin had adopted a paleo diet and the main objective of the game was to select paleo friendly food. I would love to be able to create something, simple, engaging, and fun to pair with my stellar incorporation of gifs and extremely whitty humor. 

Moving on, there are still some specifics my brain is processing. For instance, the different code blocks. Why is there such a difference between a hyphen and a comma? Why would one be so much easier to use as opposed to another? I guess I just wish there was a ginormous, extensive guide that had every keystroke explained so that the averga eperson could understand them. As I continue to create posts and learn more about the digital publishing world, I keep stumbling upon little hacks here and there that I had no clue existed. If I had an all enclusive magic coding dictionary, then these minuscule finds probably wouldn't be as exciting I guess... One of these discoveries may shock you to your inner core. Are you prepared? While I was created the lists featured above, I inserted three hyphens in its own line as a form of code block to try and make the two lists separate. However, this ended up bolding the statement above it. I found that rather odd so when I committed the changes I was shocked to see that those hyphens turned code line 10 big and green. I have never been more happy in my life to see big green letters. I guess its the little things about coding I like the most. The way you are forced to figure out what's going on and how to fix the structure of the code. In a way, its similiar to analyzing literature I suppose. The answers are never directly in front of you. The reader must review the information, assess the problem, and interpret the meaning of the text. The coder must review the information, assess the problem, and interpret the meaning of the code. Both processes so similiar yet worlds apart.
