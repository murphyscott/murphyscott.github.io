title: "Reflection 3: Achieving Goals! YAY!"
---
This week we learned about Markdown code versus HTML. Markdown and HTML have many differences including: 
1. Differences between HTML and Markdown
	* Markdown is simplier
	* HTML gives the user more control over the content and structure of the site 
	* HTML provides further information for site structures
As a new coder, I think getting my feet wet with markdown then transitioning to HTML is the best plan of action. Funny enough most of my coding goals were answered through this weeks activity. 
1. My Goals
	* insert a picture, gif, and video 
	* successfullycreate a list 
	* personalize my page 
	* organize blog with headings 
The activity and reading for this week included **ALL** of these functions. SCORE! I guess I need to start searching for new goals. Understanding HTML markup will definitely be on that list. I also want to be able to code and maybe embed a simple game. This desire spurs from my days as a preteen. One time in middle school my friend, Sophia Shams, created a game based off of her cousin's new diet. She entitled the game *Paleo Faileo* because her cousin had adopted a paleo diet and the main objective of the game was to select paleo friendly food. I would love to be able to create something, simple, engaging, and fun to pair with my stellar incorporation of gifs and extremely whitty humor.
