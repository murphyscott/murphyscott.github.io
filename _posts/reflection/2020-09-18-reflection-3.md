title: "Reflection 3: Achieving Goals! YAY!"

This week we learned about Markdown code versus HTML. Markdown and HTML have many differences including: 
Differences between HTML and Markdown
	* Markdown is simplier
	* HTML gives the user more control over the content and structure of the site 
	* HTML provides further information for site structures
As a new coder, I think getting my feet wet with markdown then transitioning to HTML is the best plan of action. Funny enough most of my coding goals were answered through this weeks activity. 
My Goals
	* insert a picture, gif, and video 
	* successfullycreate a list 
	* personalize my page 
	* organize blog with headings 
The activity and reading for this week included **ALL** of these functions. SCORE! I guess I need to start searching for new goals. Understanding HTML markup will definitely be on that list.
