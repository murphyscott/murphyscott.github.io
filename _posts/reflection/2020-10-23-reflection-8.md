I decided to get right to the point with this week's weekly gif. It's straight and to the point because this week guys, *drum roll please*, it's story time!! Doing the tracery activity was fun when it finally worked how I wanted to. This whole 'frustration till it works' theme seems to be reocurring for me as a coder. This week's biggest mistake is simple and yet so elegant. I kept forgetting to include commas between elements... Freaking commas. However, there are still some obstacles I couldn't surmount. 

One of these seemingly insurmountable obstacles has to do with the display on the blog itself. It shows up as raw code when previewed on my homepage and when I tried to include an introductory image it would mess up the generator altogether. My guess is that it has to do with the layout of the tracery in generl but I'm still very stumped. I tried adding tags, brackets, parenthesis, quotations, EVERYTHING. Yet, nothing worked.. I guess I'm just cursed or stupid when it comes to coding. I hope its just fun to watch me fail.
