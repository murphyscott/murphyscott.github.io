I decided to get right to the point with this week's weekly gif. It's straight and to the point because this week guys, *drum roll please*, it's story time!! Doing the tracery activity was fun when it finally worked how I wanted to. This whole 'frustration till it works' theme seems to be reocurring for me as a coder.
