I decided to treat this week like a chore week, not just for my home but for my digital home as well. That's right, I have built this site much like how people build their own houses. Through our reading we learned a lot about cleaning up the behind the scenes of this digital platform. Additionally, it was a good week to continue to try and mess with my stylesheet. Thus, this week's weekly gif is a live action video of me cleaning up both my digital and literal house!

Out of all of the house cleaning items, there was one that I found *EXTREMELY* helpful. Learning about the test branch tag has saved my life and my digital home! I wish I would have learned about this trick last week when I continuously broke my site for ten hours. I think I'm still struggling with the importance of all of the background actions that must be taken to clean up a digital footprint. Is it just for looks or preference or functionality? 

I found that coding is very sensitive and to be frank touchy. Seriously though, you put one wrong comma or slash in the wrong place and the entire meaning of the code changes. Similiarly to the structure of the sentence, if there is incorrect punctuation the entire meaning of the sentence changes! Things go from yelling to a question to a statement. Much like in coding, things can go from bolded to underlined to not even being there at all. 

In the beginning of this course I created a list of goals and wrote out things that I wanted to get out of this course. I feel as though I am getting closer to not only achieving the physical skills I wanted to but also the intellectual goals I set out to achieve. From understanding the importance of code to the future that it has in our world, I am very grateful that I've been able to take this course. Even though it makes me cry once a week and sometimes sounds like gibberish, it has provided me new obstacles and challenges that have made me a better learner and critical thinker. 

With everything happening in the world right now, it makes me sad that I wasn't able to experience this course in person. Not only do I think I would personally get more out of this course, but I would probably cry less. HAHA. All jokes aside, I hope my fans have been able to ride this wave with me. Once this course is over I'm not sure all of you will miss me dearly.
