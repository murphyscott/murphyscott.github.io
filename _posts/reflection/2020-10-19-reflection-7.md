This week ladies and gents we were able to venture down the Hypertext gaming blackhole. Earlier in this course I mentioned that one of my friends coded her own video game entitled *Paleo Faileo*. Not knowing it at the time, she created a hypertext game like the list of twine games given to us. It was much like the game Space Frog. They both follow a story line, have options for the player, and have the same style. This week's weekly gif is a representation of me playing all the twine games.

Space frog was similiar to a tradition game in the sense that there were user options in order to suceed or fail. However, it was unlike a traditional game because of its rigid structure. It reminds me of solo player games such as Portal 2. (That game 11/10 would recommend). An entire story with tasks is layed out for you and it guides you through the game with prompts. 

Now tying this back to English, twine games are like being thrown into an interactive story. To understand more about what I'm talking about bop on down to your netflix account and try out one of their interactive watching experiences. I would have to rate <i>Puss and Boots</i> as the best interactive experience! Much like Space Frog, you're thrown right into the action but also able to make decisions like I previously mentioned. This aspect also reminds me of <i>Clue</i> the movie because it comes with three alternate endings. I would like to thinks it's the original interactive movie/hypertext gaming experience. 

So to recap on this week I would like to reiterate some things. Space Frog is a great game! It is full of action and intrigue yet still lets the player feel in control. It reminded me of many solo player video games that have a pairing narrative. Additionally, it also resembled an interactive, virtual story. It walks you through the life of Space Frog, much like a book would, but the reader gets to control what happens. Moreover resembling Netflix's interactive movie experiences.

TLDR: 
----
<ul>
<li>watch <i>Puss and Boots</i> the interactive experience</li>
<li>play Portal 2 solo mode</li>
<li>watch <i>Clue</i> and pick your favorite ending </li>
</ul>
