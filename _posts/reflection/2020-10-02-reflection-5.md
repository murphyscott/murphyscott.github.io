While trying to make my page aesthetically pleasing I managed to do a number of things, including: deleting the theme, deleting my posts, taking all the colors away, then reinstalling the designated theme, and finally making all my active links pink. I went through hours and hours of trying to create a style sheet just to change the navigation links to pink... My sanity has gone right out the window. That's right...

This week's gif of the week entails such raw emotions that it might shock you to your inner core.

Pictured is one of my favorite TV characters ever, Nick Miller from New Girl. I definitely had to channel my inner Nick Miller this week while sorting through this activity. As Nick once said, 

<blockquote>“I want to go in my room and do weird stuff on my computer.”</blockquote

Although simple, this gif shows how I felt trying to figure out CCS and styling. I'm not sure if I'm just dumb or lazy or both. I did however cry real tears when I managed to reset my theme. If I could make my blog look like whatever I would want it to look like [this](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/fashion/the-best-fashion-blogs-ever-69888). Its subtle and understated yet classy. Instead of beige tones, however, I would like to use pink undertones. I've felt that pink is my signature color. Right now my blog looks like it was designed by a two year old with bad color coordination. I guess as long as I can still bring comedy and joy to my fans that's all I can do!

I think my next steps in my journey will be to watch more CSS tutorial videos. Watching the ones linked in the weekly reading helped me understand more about the functionality but since I was a dummie and had already imported a theme, the customization aspect of this activity has been made a little more difficult. I guess added challenges are good for the soul though! Please check back next week to see if there are any other visual changes to my blog. Maybe I'll do an extreme makeover blog edition with before and after pictures? As my followers please let me know your thoughts.
