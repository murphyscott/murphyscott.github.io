This week was a very exciting week. I have learned how to perform one of my goals: inserting an image/video.

In this week's activity I was able to create a page that displayed many beautiful gifs that go hand in hand with my reactions thus far. As I mentioned last week, this is something I hope to keep up with (just so all my fans can keep up with me). I've decided that taking handwritten notes over specific key terms is the next step for me to becoming an expert coder. It may seem counterintuitive to take handwritten notes over something that is digitally constructed; but, I am hoping this will reinforce the meaning of each code and their unique functions.
